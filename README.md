Spring examples as I learn

HelloSpringMongo -
This is a basic hello World example of Spring + MongoDb which goes through the basic CRUD operations of Mongo using a Spring based application.
This assumes MongoDb working on your localhost (Check out http://mockus.in/blog/monogodb-setup-on-windows/ for basic setup instructions).

Also this assumes a db nameds test with collection created as :
db.sequence.insert({_id: "hosting",seq: 0})

A complete walkthrough of this code will be available at http://mockus.in/blog/ real soon.
